3) Description of the project
The purpose of this project is to data mine the 2014 data set for deaths from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. In order to see developing trends in regards to deaths with certain events that occured through the year whilst validating the findings the CDC found. 


4) Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
Can we reproduce the findings of the CDC and other primary sources?

  Summary: This question was capable of being answered after pre-processing the data in order to ride of unecessary data to speed up the process. After finishing pre-processing, we developed scripts in order to calculate the same findings that CDC had listed in their 2014 death set report. 

Can we replicate the results of studies conducted by secondary analysts?

  Summary: Other analysts would discover findings in regards to suicide rate for male vs female for example. After finding this more scripts were developed in order to validate the findings of the secondary analysts. It was essential that we were capable of replicating findings from both the main and secondary analysts in order to proceed with any other further questions.

Can we provide evidence for our unconventional cause of death assumptions?

  Summary: We were capable of showing evidence for unconventional causes i.e Are there more deaths on Friday the 13th? Are there more deaths during a full moon? We showed the evidence from these questions via data visualization in order for an easier interpretation. 

5) Application of this knowledge
The application of this knowledge still leads the question "Can death be accurately predicted?" open. Our results have shown that it is not impossible to predict death, but from our findings, the percent of something effecting death is significantly low meaning it is nearly impossible for that specific thing to play a major role.
